# LavaJs (beta)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lavacharts/lava.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lavacharts/lava.js)

LavaJs is the javascript module that accompanies the [Lavacharts PHP library](https://github.com/kevinkhill/lavacharts)

## Standalone
This is still a work in progress, but as of v4.0, LavaJs can be used independently from Lavacharts.

Clone or download the repo and check out the examples folder to see how easy it can be to make charts.

Documentation will come later...
