# LavaJs.js (beta)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lavacharts/lava.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lavacharts/lava.js)

LavaJs.js is the javsacript module that accompanies the [Lavacharts PHP library](https://github.com/kevinkhill/lavacharts)

## New!
This is still a work in progress, but as of v4.0, LavaJs.js can be used independently from Lavacharts.

Clone or download the repo and check out the examples folder to see how easy it can be to make charts.

Documentation will come later...
